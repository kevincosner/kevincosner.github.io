            <b>Qualitative comparison of a real-world scene.</b> We compared results generated by our method and other methods on a 
            real-world scene. Our method uses only 11 equirectangular 360◦ images to reconstruct the scene, while other methods use 66 
            images. Compared to other methods, our method reconstructs the scene more completely.

        <font size=+1><b>Abstract</b></font><br>
        Recent multi-view stereo methods have achieved promising results with the advancement of deep learning techniques. Despite of 
        the progress, due to the limited fields of view of regular images, reconstructing large indoor environments still requires collecting 
        many images with sufficient visual overlap, which is quite labor-intensive. 360° images cover a much larger field of view than regular 
        images and would facilitate the capture process. In this paper, we present <b><i>360MVSNet</i></b>, the first deep learning network 
        for multi-view stereo with 360° images. Our method combines uncertainty estimation with a spherical sweeping module for 360° images 
        captured from multiple viewpoints in order to construct multi-scale cost volumes. By regressing volumes in a coarse-to-fine manner, 
        high-resolution depth maps can be obtained. Furthermore, we have constructed <b><i>EQMVS</i></b>, a large-scale synthetic dataset 
        that consists of over 50K pairs of RGB and depth maps in equirectangular projection. Experimental results demonstrate that our method 
        can reconstruct large synthetic and real-world indoor scenes with significantly better completeness than previous traditional and 
        learning-based methods while saving both time and effort in the data acquisition process.
